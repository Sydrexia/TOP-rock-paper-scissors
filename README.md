# TOP-rock-paper-scissors
A rock-paper-scissors game to practice javascript from The Odin Project


Breakdown:
User will type input into a form. 
I need to store that input as a JS variable. 
I need to have the computer generate a random choice.
I need to compare the two choices and determine the winner.
I need to display a message to the user to let them know if they won or lost.
